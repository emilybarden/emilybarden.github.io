		<h2>You've come to the right place.</h2>

			<h2>Who can Tri?</h2>
			<p>Anyone.</p>
			<p>You do, however, need to be able to swim and ride a bike. It helps if you have some experience in any or all of the sports, but anyone can participate in training, and competing in Triathlon.</p>
			<p>The shortest races take less than an hour to complete, the longest anywhere between 8 and 17 hours. Any distance can present a major endurance challenge that requires dedicated training in all three disciplines.</p>

			<h2>Race Day</h2>
			<p>Whistle goes.</p> 
			<p>I have ten seconds of clear water ahead and behind me to the nearest swimmers. Focusing on staying in control for the first few lengths. It feels smooth, I feel long, I feel taut.</p> 
			<p>The suit is tight but my arms are making the right shapes. 150 down already. There’s a clock halfway down the pool. I sight it on one length and check it after 50.</p> 
			<p>Wait, 40 seconds? That’s like 10 min pace. Is that right? I reach 400 and check my watch as fast as I can. 5:59.</p> 
			<p>Well that’s a PB right there.</p>

			<h2>Some of the gear and some idea</h2>
			<p>Triathletes love a bit of gear and manufacturers are only too happy to satisfy our tastes for new and shiny upgrades. Beginners entering this strange world of lycra, neoprene and carbon have a right to feel overwhelmed by choice and flabbergast by the prices.</p> 
			<p>So what do you really need to get first? What’s the minimum you need to spend? What’s the best investment for racing gains? And what DON’T you need?</p>

			<h2>The Time trial position</h2>
			<p>Your bum is going to hurt.</p>
			<p>To get the most out of aero positionsings, you have to train in the correct position. It will also put strain on your shoulders and arms. All these things can be made more comfortable through conditioning, but this takes time.</p>
